## üíÖüèΩ Linting / Coding style

Coding style is very important. It helps to maintain the code clean and easy to
read.

> The ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are
> constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ‚Ä¶making
> it
> easy to read makes it easier to write.

_Robert C. Martin (a.k.a Uncle Bob)_
