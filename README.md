# Appium + Java + Android - 2023

This project leverages the **Screenplay Design Pattern**, which promotes the
adherence to SOLID principles for better maintainability and scalability of
automated test scripts.

For a similar setup targeting iOS (Apple iPhone), visit the following
repository: [Appium + Java + iOS - 2023](https://github.com/AlexAndradeNet/appiumjavaios).

This project is inspired by and based on the work available
at [Jacobvu84's Serenity Screenplay Appium repository](https://github.com/Jacobvu84/serenity-screenplay-appium/).

## üíÖüèΩ Linting / Coding Style

Maintaining a consistent coding style is crucial for readability and
collaboration.

> "The ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are
> constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ‚Ä¶making
> it
> easy to read makes it easier to write."

### Java

Java files are formatted using the Google Java Format rules. You can check and
fix the formatting by running:

- **To check the code:**

  ```bash
  ./gradlew clean build spotlessCheck
  ```

- **To fix the code:**

  ```bash
  ./gradlew clean build spotlessApply
  ```

### Linting Gherkin Files

Gherkin files are linted using the `gherkin-lint` tool. The configuration is
available in `.gherkin-lintrc.json`. Run the following command to lint Gherkin
files:

```bash
sh gherkin_check.sh
```
